# Frontend Mentor – NFT Preview Card Component Solution

This is my solution to the **NFT Preview Card Component** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).  
The challenge helped me improve my **HTML and CSS skills** by building a modern and responsive NFT product card with hover interactions and a clean UI.

## Overview
This project is a **static NFT preview card component** that showcases a fictional NFT called *Equilibrium #3429*.  
The card displays the NFT image, price in ETH, availability time remaining, and creator information.

The component features:
- A clean and minimalist design  
- Gradient hover overlay on the NFT image  
- Colored hover state on title and creator name  
- Responsive layout centered both vertically and horizontally  
- Subtle shadows and rounded edges that highlight the card on dark background  

## The Challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the layout correctly depending on their device screen size  
- See **hover effects** on the NFT image (cyan gradient overlay)  
- See **hover effects** on the NFT title and creator name (text color change)  
- Navigate the component easily thanks to a clear visual hierarchy

## My Process
1. Started by structuring the card using **semantic HTML** with the BEM naming convention for better organization.  
2. Imported the **Outfit** font from Google Fonts to match the original design.    
3. Built the component layout with **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** to align internal sections.  
4. Defined a full **color palette using CSS variables** to keep the styles clean and scalable.  
5. Added **hover states** to the image, title and creator name to reinforce interactivity.  
6. Adjusted spacing, borders, and shadows to match the aesthetic of the original design.  

## Built With
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Flexbox  
- CSS Grid  
- CSS Variables  
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

## What I Learned
- How to use **CSS variables** to manage an entire color system for consistent theming.  
- How to apply **overlay effects** with `linear-gradient()` and `background-image` for hover states.  
- How to combine **Flexbox and Grid** to center components smoothly across devices.  
- How **BEM naming convention** improves scalability and readability.  
- How small UI details — shadows, border radius, spacing — strongly impact the final visual result.

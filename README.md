# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component

![Design preview for the NFT preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

I completed the **NFT preview card component** challenge from Frontend Mentor.
It was built with **HTML and CSS**, following the provided design as closely as possible.

Main features:

* Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
* Hover effects on interactive elements

This was a great practice to improve my CSS skills and work with a real-world component design.
